*Are you using `CenTrace`? If so, let us know! Shoot us an email at censoredplanet@umich.edu.*

`CenTrace` is a general-purpose application-layer censorship traceroute tool, that sends TTL-limited HTTP, TLS, and DNS packets to detect the network locations of censorship devices. `CenTrace` can perform requests to different endpoints parallely using specified domains. It first tests to see whether there is any sign of interference for a particular measurement, by comparing responses with a control measurement. If there is an indication of blocking, it then performs multiple repetitions of two traceroutes to the endpoint - one with the test domain and the other with a control domain- to determine the network path to the endpoint, and the exact location of the blocking. `CenTrace` has the following features:
1.  It can detect censorship devices that inject packets (such as a TCP RST packet or a blockpage) as well as devices that drop packets (and induce a timeout).
2.  `CenTrace` can differentiate between in-path (processing packets at line rate) and on-path (receiving only a copy of the packets) devices.  
3.  `CenTrace` accounts for stateful blocking by including a customizable delay between successive traceroutes and measurements. 
4.  `CenTrace` follows the method used by [Tracebox](http://www.tracebox.org/) to compare the quoted packets in ICMP error response to detect middleboxes. 
5.  `CenTrace` uses the IP record-route option to add additional information about the location of middleboxes when the network path supports the option. 
6.  `CenTrace` repeats probes multiple times to account for network path variance and calculates the most likely location of the middlebox. 
7.  `CenTrace` can identify censorship devices that copy TTL values from the IP header of sent packets. 

`CenTrace` can record packet captures, and analyze them to produce a final outcome containing a response code (overall type of outcome), the type of censorship response, the terminating hops in the control and test `CenTrace` measurement, the payloads in the control and test `CenTrace` measurement and whether they differ, whether the device is on-path or in-path, and the IP, ASN, and Country of the censoring and surrounding hops. Each measurement is recorded in a different packet capture file (refer to `examples/pcaps/`). These `pcaps` can then be analyzed using the analysis component of `CenTrace`.

## Installation
- Install Python v3.9 or newer, see <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/>
- **Set your IPTABLES to drop outbound RST packets for the measurement, since `CenTrace` uses the [scapy](https://scapy.net/) library, which runs at user-level.**
- Install required dependencies using pip - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

## Usage
The `CenTrace` tool provides two functions:
1. Run traceroute measurements across a list of endpoints: 
```
sudo python3 traceroute.py --filename examples/input.csv -o examples/output.csv -v -l examples/log.txt --iprr --comparequoted -r 5 -R 120 -p -pd examples/pcaps -m 2 -i enp1s0f1 -rv routeviews_file -an asnames_file --application_protocol https -cr 2 -mi 3
```
2. Analyze pcaps:
 ```
python3.9 pcap_parse.py --dir examples/pcaps/ -rv routeviews_file -an asnames_file --summary -o examples/analyzed_output.csv 
```

## Disclaimer
Using `CenTrace` from your machine may place you at risk if you use it within a highly censoring regime. `CenTrace` takes actions that try to trigger censoring middleboxes multiple times, and try to interfere with the functioning of the middlebox. Therefore, please exercice caution while using the tool, and understand the risks of running `CenTrace` before using it on your machine. Please refer to [our paper](https://ramakrishnansr.org/publications) for more information.
